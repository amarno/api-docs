# Order Activity

Order Activity will show up on a person's activity timeline as an event. The event is based on the <code>action</code> sent with the order payload. For example, sending <code>placed</code> will result in a "Placed an order" event and sending <code>updated</code> will result in an "Updated an order" event.

Drip will keep a person’s Lifetime Value (LTV) up-to-date with their orders. For example, if a customer places an order with a <code>grand_total</code> of $100, their LTV will be incremented by $100. If the order is then updated, paid, or fulfilled with a <code>grand_total</code> value of $105, the customer’s LTV will increase by $5. If the order is then canceled or refunded with a <code>refund_amount</code> of $105, the customer’s LTV will decrease by $105.

## Create or update an order

To update an existing order, include the <code>provider</code> and <code>order_id</code> for that order in the payload.

The API will also allow custom attributes to be passed in. These will be exposed within Drip just like [event properties](https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003737312-Event-Properties).

For example, if your platform includes the concept of product tags, you can include a product_tag attribute in the JSON that can be used in a Drip automation or email [via Liquid](https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003737312-Event-Properties#access-properties). You can attach custom attributes either to events or their items.
