# Product Activity

Using the Product Activity endpoint will enable product-triggered automations in your Drip account. An example: price drop notifications. Send an email when a product in a customerâ€™s cart drops in price, encouraging the customer to return and place an order.

## Create or update a product

To update an existing product, include the <code>provider</code> and <code>product_id</code> for that order in the payload.

> To record an order event:

curl -X POST "https://api.getdrip.com/v3/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/shopper_activity/product" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H 'User-Agent: Your App Name (www.yourapp.com)' \
